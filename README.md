## 👋 Hey, I'm João Vitor Rodrigues
Telecom Engineer & Infra Dev | Python, C++, SQL | Building AI-ready voice systems

I'm a **Telecommunications Engineer** and **Infrastructure-focused Backend Developer**, working at the intersection of **real-time communication**, **systems engineering**, and **AI-driven pipelines**. I bring a unique blend of telecom protocol knowledge, backend experience, and automation skills to build practical, high-impact systems.

🔧 Core strengths:
- Languages: **Python**, **Bash**, **SQL**, with experience in **C++**, **JavaScript**, and **PHP**
- Systems: Backend development using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **Kafka**, **PostgreSQL**
- Protocols: Deep understanding of **VoIP**, **SIP**, and **RTC** from my telecom background
- DevOps Focus: Currently pursuing a **postgraduate specialization in DevOps & Continuous Engineering** at **PUC-MG**
- AI Integration: Currently exploring **Whisper**, **GPT-4**, and other LLMs to design audio-to-insight pipelines

🧠 Currently building a **Voice Intelligence Pipeline**:
> Audio ➝ transcription ➝ summarization ➝ AI-driven sentiment & insights  
> Demonstrating orchestration, real-time data handling, and multi-AI integration

🛠️ Previously worked as a **backend developer for 9 months**, contributing to systems in **C++** and **PHP/JavaScript** environments—bringing efficiency and scalability to production services.

🌍 Seeking remote roles in **AI-integrated infrastructure**, **backend systems**, or **communications platforms**.

> Code meets comms. Infra meets AI. Systems built to scale.
